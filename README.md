# sm64-moonshine
Its hard to get moonshine on platforms that are not Windows. The replace, merge, etc, it just does not work on other platforms like Linux and Mac. So here it is, I bring moonshine in a much easier way, like any other repo.

# Install
clone the repository, then cd into sm64-moonshine, then run make -j on Linux, or gmake OSX_BUILD=1 -j on Mac/OSX.
